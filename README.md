# supplychain-anomaly-detection

This project uses python aiming to make a anomaly detection system for identifying unusual patterns in supplier profiles, including price anomalies, lead times anomaly, and high risk supplier/product combinations.
- Price Anomalies: detect suppliers with high costs compare to similar items
- Lead Time Outliers: identify unusual lead times to address supply chain issues.
- Risk Patterns: flag high-risk supplier/product combanations using ML
- Regional Anomalies: detect abnormal pricing patterns by supplier region.
